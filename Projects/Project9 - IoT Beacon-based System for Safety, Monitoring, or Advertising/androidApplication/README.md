### ■&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Introduction
▣ The project is part of the IITP Summer Program, and **Korean universities & Purdue university** participated together.<br>
▣ The members consist of 6 **pusan national University** students and 1 **Purdue University** student.<br>
▣ This project's goal is to improve the problems of previous disaster prevention systems using IoT technology.<br>
<br>
_It has the following advantages:_
#### **1. Accurate information collection and secure information reliability through a separate network.**
- It has a wider sensing distance than Bluetooth.
- Detailed location information can be identified.


#### **2. A low unit price compared to previous communication technology.**
- It can be maintained for a long time with low power using Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE)
- It is advantageous for real-time large data processing.

### ■&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Differentiation
- Through constant interaction with Beacon, users' information is updated periodically.
- This information is used to control Personnel and to figure out people locate in disaster accidents in real time.
- It is expected to reduce bottlenecks and panics that have increased the scale of disasters.
